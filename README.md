# Final product: 

## File structure:
    We have a messy file structure. Sorry. We are too scared to fix it/move files because of how our data is linked and formatting from D3 to D4. This was our main takeaway -- use a better file structure before you're in too deep.

## Original data and transformations:
    Timeline visualization: https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2016/tables/table-1/table_1_incidents_offenses_victims_and_known_offenders_by_bias_motivation_2016.xls/output.xls (This is one year of the data. Full data pull included the 2011-2016 files that all looked like this. 
    Data transformation notes: 
        -Pulled the data down from the FBI site
        -Used a vlookup to pull the data from each year into the same file with columns for the different years
        -Transposed the data so that it would line up correctly to be changed into a csv
        -Transformed the data from an excel file into a csv

## Visualization modifications:
    Timeline visual (Josh): I changed the number and formatting of the ticks. 
    Map visual (Josh): I reformatted the size and numbering of the scale as well as the range of numbers that it was looking for. 
    Economic visual (Jevon): I changed color scheme to color-blind friendly using http://colorbrewer2.org/
    Education visual (Aneliese): I deleted the function to switch to a new visual, changed colors/font color/font size, deleted legend and color coding, resized chart elements and axis

    1/9: Class scrum. Discuss datasets and outline website visuals (no blockers)
    1/10: Phone scrum. Touch base; update on progress. No blockers
    1/11: Class scrum. Informal. Blockers: Font issues, education data issues (controlling for population/crime rate)

    On Trello
  
  ## GitHut collab: 
    We chose to talk via Slack/text/phone/in-person versus commenting on GitHub. NOTE-- we had some GitHub issues in the beginning of the project; a dozen or so commits were lost and show as one big commit at the start. 
  
  ## Retrospective: 
    Individual retrospectives on Slack. Group agreed to:
    START: Create and use standard file structure!! Our main takeaway!!
    STOP: Using user stories that don't relate to project
    CONTINUE: Frequent, short scrum meetings that facilitate effective communication
