  ## Burn down: 
    On Trello
  
  ## GitHut collab: 
    We chose to talk via Slack/text/phone/in-person versus commenting on GitHub. NOTE-- we had some GitHub issues in the beginning of the project; a dozen or so commits were lost and show as one big commit at the start. 
  
  ## Retrospective: On Slack. Group agreed:
    START: Create and use standard file structure!! Our main takeaway!!
    STOP: Using user stories that don't relate to project
    CONTINUE: Frequent, short scrum meetings that facilitate effective communication
