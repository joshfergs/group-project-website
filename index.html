<h2>Hate Crime & Education</h2>
<p>A county's average level of education and its rate of reported hate crimes have no significant correlation. The clear lack of any relationship between schooling and hate crime may come as a surprise; education is frequently touted as one of the most useful tools in fighting bigotry. While our data may be confounded by other variables, it serves us to know that one must not expect nor assume that more educated areas are less prone to hate crime.</p>
